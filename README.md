# How to run the project

### 1. Install Python 3 (if not installed yet)

Go to the official website and download the latest version:

https://www.python.org/downloads/

- **Windows**: Download the installer, run it, and **MAKE SURE** to check the box
  `Add python.exe to PATH` (at the bottom of the installer window) before clicking "Install Now".

- **macOS**: 
  - I recommend installing via the official installer from the website above (not just Homebrew).
  - Or via Homebrew: `brew install python@3.12`

- **Linux** (Ubuntu/Debian): Python is usually already present, but if you need to update:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip -y
  How to Run:
Follow these steps in your terminal or command prompt:
Open the terminal/command prompt.
Navigate to the correct drive (if on Windows and the project is on a different drive than C:):
   "E:"
   Enter the main project folder (e.g., python pr):
   "cd python pr"
   Navigate into the next project subfolder (e.g., guessthenumber), if necessary:
   "cd guessthenomber"
   Finally, run the project file using the following command:
   "python game.py"
   ```
